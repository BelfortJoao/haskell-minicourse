# Haskell Mini-Course - Game of Life Simulation

This repository contains the project developed during the Haskell mini-course at SECOM UFV, which includes a simulation of the Game of Life.

## Description

The Haskell mini-course project includes a simulation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway. The Game of Life is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. The project demonstrates the implementation of the game using Haskell, a functional programming language, and provides an educational resource for learning Haskell programming concepts.

## Features

- Simulation of Conway's Game of Life
